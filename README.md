## advanced-databases-ntua: MapReduce, PySpark, HDFS, K-Means
An ML system developed with PySpark and MapReduce, that reads from HDFS a dataset of trip records from all trips completed in yellow taxis in NYC from January to June in 2015, and finds the coordinates of the top five client-pickup locations using K-Means clustering.  

## How to run
1. Upload data in Hadoom File System  
```
hadoop fs -put ./yellow_tripdata_1m.csv hdfs://master:9000/yellow_tripdata_1m.csv
```
2. Install pyspark  
```
pip install pyspark
```
3. Submit task in Spark environment  
```
